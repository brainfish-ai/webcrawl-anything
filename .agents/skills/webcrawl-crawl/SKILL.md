description: Use when converting any web page, SPA, PDF, Office doc, YouTube video, GitHub repo, or ArXiv paper into clean LLM-ready Markdown, or when a plain fetch/curl/scrape of a URL returns broken, empty, or boilerplate-heavy content. Covers webcrawl (webcrawl-anything, npx webcrawl) tasks like scrape, crawl, map/llms.txt, and extract, plus searching the live web with category: shopping, flights, hotels, real-estate, security/CVE, github, arxiv. Trigger when the user gives a URL and wants its content, wants to crawl multiple pages or a whole docs site, needs structured data from a page, or asks "what does this page say". Skip for single-symbol code questions, local-file reading, or when the content is already in the conversation.

# Webcrawl — turn any URL into clean Markdown

`webcrawl` converts URLs into LLM-ready Markdown with zero API keys. It handles websites and JS SPAs, PDFs and Office docs, YouTube videos (transcripts), GitHub repos, ArXiv papers, shopping/travel/real-estate listings, and CVE advisories — from one CLI (`npx webcrawl`) and one MCP server (`@webcrawl/mcp`).

## Quick start (10 seconds)

```bash
# Any URL to clean Markdown (zero keys, local)
npx webcrawl scrape https://github.com/torvalds/linux

# Check engine readiness first if anything fails
npx webcrawl doctor
```

Use `npx webcrawl setup` to register the MCP server + this skill for Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / Gemini / Windsurf in one command.

## Decision rules

| The task is… | Use |
|---|---|
| One URL → its content | `scrape` |
| Many pages under one path/domain | `crawl` |
| Discover all URLs on a domain | `map` (sitemap.xml + robots.txt + link graph) |
| Structured JSON from a page | `extract --prompt "…"` |
| Live web / vertical search | `search "…" -c <category>` |

**Use webcrawl instead of raw `fetch`/curl** when: the page is JS-rendered (SPA), you want Markdown instead of HTML, you need tables/links/code blocks preserved, or the target has a bot check. Raw fetch is fine for plain static HTML APIs and JSON endpoints.

## Core commands

```bash
# Scrape (single URL → Markdown)
npx webcrawl scrape https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks
npx webcrawl scrape https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ   # transcript
npx webcrawl scrape https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762              # paper
npx webcrawl scrape https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms.txt      # docs manifest

# Map (discover URLs), then crawl the interesting ones
npx webcrawl map https://docs.stripe.com --filter webhook -n 50
npx webcrawl crawl https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks -n 5

# Structured extraction
npx webcrawl extract https://news.ycombinator.com --prompt "top 5 stories with points"

# Categorized search
npx webcrawl search "sony wh-1000xm5" -c shopping
npx webcrawl search "boutique hotels in shibuya" -c hotels
npx webcrawl search "3 bedroom house in marrickville" -c real-estate --sub buy
npx webcrawl search "CVE-2024-3094 xz utils" -c security --sub cve
npx webcrawl search "react 19 compiler" -n 5
```

All commands also work through the MCP server (`@webcrawl/mcp`) with the same names (`scrape`, `crawl`, `map`, `search`, `extract`).

## Expected output

`scrape` returns clean Markdown with semantic headings, tables, code blocks, links, OpenGraph/JSON-LD, and a SHA-256 content hash. `crawl` returns per-page results in parallel (up to 25 default) with target evidence. `search` returns ranked results with provider attribution. `extract` returns structured JSON matching your prompt.

## Validation loop

1. Run the scrape. If output is empty, a challenge page, or an error → see `references/troubleshooting.md`.
2. Check Markdown quality: headings present, no raw HTML tags, tables intact, no nav/footer boilerplate.
3. For multi-page work, verify the URL list from `map` before crawling (`crawl` accepts a filter).
4. If a target needs a key or proxy (e.g. cloud stealth browsers), `npx webcrawl doctor` will say so.

## Compliance

Respect robots.txt and site terms; webcrawl reads robots.txt and caches by content hash to avoid repeat hits. Rate-limit politely for bulk crawling. See `references/troubleshooting.md` for the anti-bot tier ladder if a site challenges automated clients.
