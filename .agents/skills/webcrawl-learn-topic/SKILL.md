name: webcrawl-learn-topic
description: Use when the user wants to learn about a topic, research a subject across the open web, build a cited research digest or literature review, compare sources on a question, or produce a "deep research" style report with sources. Covers finding authoritative pages on a topic (search engines, docs sites, llms.txt, ArXiv, GitHub), crawling them into clean Markdown with webcrawl, extracting key facts with source URLs, and synthesizing a cited digest. Trigger for "learn about X", "research topic X", "deep research on X", "give me a reading list for X", "what's the state of X in 2026", "summarize the latest thinking on X". Skip for one quick fact (a single search/scrape may suffice), content already in the conversation, or strictly offline questions.

# Webcrawl — learn any topic with cited sources

A repeatable search-then-crawl research loop: discover authoritative pages, crawl them into clean Markdown, extract claims with citations, and synthesize a digest the user can trust because every fact links to its source.

## Quick start

```bash
# Discover sources for a topic
npx webcrawl search "transformer architectures survey 2026" -n 10

# Read the promising ones into Markdown
npx webcrawl scrape https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
npx webcrawl map https://docs.some-framework.dev --filter architecture -n 20
npx webcrawl crawl https://docs.some-framework.dev/architecture -n 5
```

## The research loop

1. **Scope the question.** Decide what would count as a good answer and what sources are authoritative for this topic (official docs, papers, reputable engineering blogs, standards bodies).
2. **Search broadly first.** Run 2-3 `webcrawl search` queries with different phrasings. Add `-c arxiv` style category filters when the topic is academic; keep general web search otherwise.
3. **Select pages to crawl.** From search results pick 5-15 URLs: official/primary sources first, then high-signal secondary ones. Use `map` + `--filter` on docs sites to find the exact sub-pages instead of guessing URLs.
4. **Crawl to Markdown.** Use `scrape` for single pages, `crawl` for multi-page docs. YouTube talks and PDFs are fine too (transcripts and page-numbered Markdown come back built-in).
5. **Extract with citations.** For each crawled page, pull the claims relevant to the question, each with its source URL. `extract --prompt "key claims about X with quotes"` can help; otherwise read the Markdown directly.
6. **Synthesize.** Write the digest: a short answer up top, then themes/sections, each fact cited to its source URL, then open questions and a reading list. Never state a fact without a URL you actually crawled.
7. **Verify.** Spot-check 2-3 citations by re-scraping the source page and confirming the claim appears there.

## Source-quality rules

- Prefer primary sources: official docs, papers, repos, standards, vendor announcements.
- Cross-check contested claims across 2+ independent sources; if sources disagree, say so and cite both.
- Include publication dates where available; flag anything older than ~2 years for fast-moving topics.
- If a source page challenges automated clients, the webcrawl ladder handles it (see the protected-sites skill); don't skip a primary source because it's protected.

## Output shape

```markdown
# Topic: <topic>
## TL;DR (3-5 sentences, no citations needed here)
## Key findings (bullets, each with [source](url))
## How sources disagree (if applicable)
## Open questions
## Reading list (ranked, with one-line "why read this")
```

## Validation loop

- Every claim has a source URL that was actually crawled.
- At least 3 distinct domains among the sources (unless the topic is single-vendor).
- Digest length fits the ask (short briefing vs deep report).
- Re-verify one random citation end-to-end before delivering.
