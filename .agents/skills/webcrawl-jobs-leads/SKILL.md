name: webcrawl-jobs-leads
description: Use when gathering job postings or sales leads from the web — crawling company career pages, Greenhouse/Lever/Workable boards, job boards, or "companies hiring" pages, normalizing postings into structured data (title, team, location, remote, salary, link), tracking new postings since the last check, ranking fit against the user's resume or criteria, and building lead/prospect lists from company pages (hiring signals, tech stack, scale). Trigger for "find every job posting at companies using X", "track new postings on this careers page", "build me a lead list of Y companies that are hiring", "normalize these job listings into a spreadsheet", "which startups are hiring for Z role". Skip for applying to jobs automatically (this skill finds and structures jobs, it never applies), LinkedIn scraping behind login, or bulk recruiter spam.

# Webcrawl — job-market & lead intelligence

Company careers pages and ATS boards (Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, Ashby) are public, fragmented, and change daily. webcrawl reads them all — JS-heavy SPAs included — into clean Markdown, and `extract` normalizes postings into structured rows.

**Finds and structures only.** It never auto-applies, never touches logged-in LinkedIn, and isn't for spamming recruiters.

## Quick start

```bash
# Read a careers page (JS-heavy boards included)
npx webcrawl scrape https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme

# Normalize postings into structured JSON
npx webcrawl extract https://boards.greenhouse.io/acme \
  --prompt "all job postings: title, team/department, location, remote policy, link"

# Discover the board's URL space first when unknown
npx webcrawl map https://www.acme.com --filter careers -n 30
```

## Workflow

1. **Define the target list.** A list of company careers URLs or ATS boards (e.g. `boards.greenhouse.io/<company>`, `jobs.lever.co/<company>`), or a discovery query (`webcrawl search "companies hiring <role> in <city>"`).
2. **Crawl each board.** `scrape` the board index; most ATS boards render server-side so the zero-key tiers read them directly. For SPA boards, the stealth tier handles rendering.
3. **Normalize with extract.** One pass per board: `extract --prompt "postings with title, team, location, remote, salary if present, absolute job URL"`. Store rows in one dataset (`jobs.json` or CSV).
4. **Dedupe and diff.** Key on job URL. On re-runs, diff against the stored set: new postings = leads worth surfacing; gone postings = filled roles.
5. **Rank fit (optional).** Score each posting against the user's criteria or resume keywords — keep it explainable (matched keywords + years signal), not a black box.
6. **Schedule.** Overnight or daily re-crawls with cron or an agent scheduler. Be polite: one pass per board per day is plenty; never hammer ATS boards.
7. **Deliver.** A ranked table (title | company | location | remote | salary | link | new-since-last-run) plus a summary of what changed.

## Lead list variant (sales)

Same loop, different extraction: for each company page, extract hiring signals (roles open, engineering headcount proxy, growth teams), tech-stack hints, and contactable public pages. Output a lead sheet with a "why now" column (e.g. "hiring 3 SREs — infra pain" → pitch relevance).

## Validation loop

- Spot-check 3 extracted rows against the live board: title, location, and link all match real postings.
- Every job URL is absolute and resolves (no relative links left in the data).
- New-posting diff is stable across two consecutive runs (no phantom adds/drops from flaky extraction).
- No page was a challenge shell (ATS boards usually aren't protected; if one is, see webcrawl-protected-sites).

## Compliance

Only public pages, respect robots.txt and site terms, keep daily cadence, and honor ATS boards' published intent (they're posted for candidates to read). Never log into or bypass auth walls.
