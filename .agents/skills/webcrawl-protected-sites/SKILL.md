description: Use when a website or page returns a bot check, CAPTCHA, DataDome, Cloudflare, AWS WAF, PerimeterX, or 403/202 challenge instead of real content — or when scraping a travel, ticketing, or e-commerce site that commonly challenges automated clients (Expedia, Booking, StubHub, Ticketmaster, and similar). Covers the webcrawl anti-bot tier ladder (TLS-impersonation → curl-impersonate → residential proxy → real-browser stealth), residential proxy setup via WEBCRAWL_PROXY_* env vars, retry strategy, and diagnosing which tier was used. Trigger when fetch/curl/scrape gets blocked, status 403/429/202 with a challenge, "Access denied", "Checking your browser", "Just a moment", or an empty shell page with no content. Skip when the page simply does not exist (404), when the user has no right to access the content, or when normal scrape already works.

# Webcrawl — reading sites that challenge automated clients

Many sites run bot checks (DataDome, Cloudflare, AWS WAF, PerimeterX). webcrawl has a tiered fallback ladder that starts zero-key and only escalates when a lower tier is blocked. Your job: run the ladder, observe which tier wins, and configure the optional residential proxy when needed.

## The tier ladder

webcrawl tries tiers in order and remembers (per-domain, 1h TTL) which tier succeeded:

1. **`impit-tls`** — zero-key TLS-impersonated HTTP fetch (default). Beats most basic fingerprinting.
2. **`impersonate`** — curl-impersonate with a pinned real-Chrome TLS fingerprint (JA3/JA4 + HTTP/2 frame order). Wins most Cloudflare/AWS-WAF checks.
3. **`proxy-impersonate`** — same fingerprint through a residential proxy. Needed when the block is IP-based (datacenter egress blocked). Requires env config (below).
4. **Stealth browser** — a real Chrome/Chromium (warm-session, solved cookies reused across tiers) for the hardest DataDome/JS challenges, optionally also through the proxy.
5. **Render provider (`tier: "render"`)** — for pages the ladder *passes* but cannot render (JS SPA shells that pass the bot check, listings that only appear client-side). When `WEBCRAWL_RENDER_URL` is set (hosted cloud mode sets it server-side; self-hosted any provider), the engine renders through the provider; render-needed domains are memoized like proxy-needed ones. In zero-key local mode it is unset, and the shell comes back with an honest limitation note pointing at `webcrawl login` + `--mode cloud`.

## Quick start

```bash
# Just try it — the ladder runs automatically on scrape/crawl/search
npx webcrawl scrape https://www.stubhub.com/chicago-cubs-tickets/venue/8660/

# If it comes back blocked/shell, enable the residential proxy tier:
export WEBCRAWL_PROXY_URL="http://user:pass@gateway:port"   # any HTTP residential proxy
# or: WEBCRAWL_PROXY_USER / WEBCRAWL_PROXY_PWD (+ WEBCRAWL_PROXY_HOST/PORT)
npx webcrawl scrape https://www.expedia.com/Hotels

# Diagnose which tier served the page:
npx webcrawl doctor
```

**Proxy note:** any HTTP(S) residential proxy works — Decodo, Bright Data, Oxylabs, IPRoyal, or your own. Set env vars, nothing else changes.

## Workflow

1. **Try plain scrape first.** Most "blocked" pages succeed on `impit-tls` or `impersonate` with no config.
2. **Read the diagnostics.** The result reports the fetch tier used and proxy bytes transferred. A `tier: "impersonate"` win with real content means you're done — don't add a proxy.
3. **If the response is a challenge shell** (empty page, "Checking your browser", status 403/429, or ~40-char challenge text): the domain is likely IP-blocked. Set `WEBCRAWL_PROXY_URL` and retry — the ladder will retry through the residential hop automatically.
4. **Memoization:** once a domain is marked proxy-needed, later requests skip straight to the proxy tier (1h TTL). The first protected-site hit pays the ladder cost; subsequent hits are fast.
5. **Hardest cases:** if the proxy tier still shows a challenge, the stealth-browser tier runs (needs local Chrome or a sandbox). Harvested cookies from the browser tier are persisted back into the session store, so lightweight tiers reuse them on later runs.

## Reading the result

```json
{ "url": "...", "status": 200, "tier": "proxy-impersonate", "proxyBytes": 51234 }
```

- `status: 200` + real content + `tier` tells you which tier won.
- `proxyBytes > 0` means the residential proxy was used (billable on your proxy account).
- A 200 with a tiny shell / no real text is still a challenge — escalate one tier.

## Validation loop

1. Scrape once with no proxy. Real content? Done.
2. Challenge shell? Set proxy env vars, scrape again. Check `tier`/`proxyBytes` in the output.
3. Still blocked? Run `npx webcrawl doctor` — it reports engine, Chrome, and proxy readiness.
4. Verify content is real: title matches, headings present, substantive text length — not a 40-char challenge shell.

## Compliance

Use on content you have a right to read; respect robots.txt and site terms; keep request rates low. Anti-bot tiers exist to let legitimate automated clients read pages a normal browser could — not to hammer sites or evade purchase limits.
