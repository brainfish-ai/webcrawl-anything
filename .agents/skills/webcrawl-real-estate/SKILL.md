description: Use when searching or monitoring real-estate and rental listings — finding properties for sale or rent, extracting structured listing data (bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, price, suburb, agent, link) with webcrawl's built-in real-estate parser, tracking new listings or price changes on a watchlist of suburbs/portals, comparing portals (realestate.com.au, Domain, Zillow), and alerting the user when matching homes appear or prices drop. Trigger for "find 3-bedroom houses in <suburb> under $X", "watch this suburb for new listings", "track rental prices in <area>", "alert me when this property's price changes", "compare listings across portals". Skip for non-property web pages, mortgage/legal analysis, or contacting agents (this skill finds and structures listings, it does not transact).

# Webcrawl — real-estate listings & alerts

webcrawl ships a built-in zero-key real-estate extractor (`-c real-estate`) that returns structured listing rows (bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, price, suburb, portal, image, link) — no API keys, no fragile CSS selectors.

## Quick start

```bash
# Structured listing search straight from the CLI
npx webcrawl search "3 bedroom house in marrickville" -c real-estate --sub buy
npx webcrawl search "2 bedroom apartment in bronte" -c real-estate --sub rent

# Extract listings from a specific portal page
npx webcrawl extract "https://www.realestate.com.au/buy/in-marrickville+nsw-2204" \
  --prompt "listings: price, address, bedrooms, bathrooms, link"

# Scrape a listing detail page into Markdown
npx webcrawl scrape "https://www.realestate.com.au/property/..."
```

## Workflow

1. **Define the search.** Suburb(s), buy/rent/sold, filters (beds, price cap, property type). `--sub buy|rent|sold` selects the listing class.
2. **Pull structured listings.** `search "…" -c real-estate --sub <class>` returns normalized rows; repeat per suburb. For portal-specific pages, `extract` with a listing prompt works too.
3. **Normalize + dedupe.** Key listings on address+portal (the same property can appear on realestate.com.au and Domain). Keep: address, price (parsed to a number + period), beds/baths/parking, listing URL, first-seen date.
4. **Store state.** `state.json` per suburb-watch: seen listing keys with `{price, firstSeen, lastSeen}`.
5. **Schedule re-checks.** Daily is plenty for real estate (listings change daily at most). Cron or agent scheduler; one pass per portal per day.
6. **Detect changes.** Diff new results against state: new matching listing, price reduction (common as auctions approach), listing withdrawn. Price-reduction rows are gold — surface them first.
7. **Alert (optional).** Push new/reduced matches to mobile via ntfy.sh (see the deal-watch skill's alerting reference — same pattern):
   ```bash
   curl -d "New 3BR in Marrickville — $1.35M — <link>" -H "Title: New listing" ntfy.sh/my-topic
   ```
8. **Deliver.** A table of matches (address | price | beds/baths/car | link | change-type) plus a one-line summary of the market snapshot (median of matches, count new vs last week).

## Portal notes

- Portals are moderately protected — the anti-bot ladder handles most pages; for heavily-challenged ones set `WEBCRAWL_PROXY_URL` (see webcrawl-protected-sites).
- Some portals paginate via JS; use `map` to find page URLs or scrape the paginated links directly.
- "Sold" data lags by days-to-weeks; treat sold prices as history, not live.

## Validation loop

- Spot-check 2 rows against the live portal page: price and beds match the listing.
- Every listing link resolves to the right property.
- The seen-listings state grows monotonically (no phantom re-adding of the same address on each run).
- Confirm price-change alerts reflect real price cuts (re-scrape the listing once).

## Compliance

Public listing pages only; respect portal terms and robots.txt; keep a once-daily cadence; don't rebuild a competing portal from scraped data — that's a ToS violation. This helps a human find a home.
