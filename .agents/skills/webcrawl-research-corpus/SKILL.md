description: Use when building a corpus of clean Markdown documents from one or more websites for RAG, fine-tuning, embeddings, or a knowledge base — crawling docs sites, sitemaps, whole domains, or a curated URL list into LLM-ready files. Covers webcrawl multi-page crawling (npx webcrawl crawl/map), llms.txt manifests, path scoping to stay on-target, robots.txt compliance, caching to avoid re-crawls, dedupe, and chunk-friendly output. Trigger for "crawl site X into Markdown for my RAG pipeline", "build a knowledge base from these docs", "scrape the whole docs section", "export these pages for embeddings", "corpus building". Skip for a single page (use webcrawl-crawl scrape), protected-site challenges (see webcrawl-protected-sites), or non-web sources.

# Webcrawl — build a RAG-ready Markdown corpus

Turn a docs site or domain into clean, chunk-friendly Markdown files for RAG and embeddings. webcrawl gives you URL discovery (`map`), scoped multi-page crawling (`crawl`), content-addressed caching, and SHA-256 content hashes for dedupe.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Discover the URL space
npx webcrawl map https://docs.stripe.com --filter webhook -n 50

# 2. Crawl the scoped section into Markdown
npx webcrawl crawl https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks -n 25

# 3. If the site publishes llms.txt, use it as the canonical page list
npx webcrawl scrape https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms.txt
```

## Workflow

1. **Inventory the source.** Try `llms.txt` first (many docs sites publish one; it lists their canonical crawlable pages). Otherwise `map` builds the URL list from sitemap.xml + robots.txt + link graph.
2. **Scope tightly.** Crawl under the section path you need (`/docs/webhooks`, not the whole domain). `--filter` on `map` keeps the URL list on-topic; the path-scope engine prevents off-site drift.
3. **Crawl with a budget.** `crawl -n <max>` runs pages in parallel (default 25). For larger corpora, loop over section roots with a small pause between batches.
4. **Write files as you go.** Save each page as `<corpus>/<slug>.md` with a small header (`url`, `crawledAt`, `sha256`) — webcrawl returns the content hash per page.
5. **Dedupe.** Track hashes; skip pages whose hash you've already stored (boilerplate/symlink duplicates). Cross-run, compare new hashes against the stored set and only re-embed changed pages.
6. **Re-crawl cheaply.** The engine's content cache (keyed by SHA-256) means unchanged pages don't need re-processing; changed pages surface as new hashes.
7. **Chunk for RAG.** webcrawl's Markdown keeps semantic headings — split on `\n## ` boundaries (or use a header-aware chunker) and keep the URL in each chunk's metadata for citation-grounded answers.

## Output shape

```markdown
---
url: https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks
crawledAt: "2026-11-01T00:00:00Z"
sha256: "…"
---
<clean Markdown with headings, tables, code blocks>
```

## Validation loop

- Spot-check 3 files: headings present, no nav/footer boilerplate, code blocks intact.
- Hash-coverage check: number of unique hashes ≈ number of stored files (dupes caught).
- Re-run `crawl` once; confirm unchanged pages are cache hits (no refetch).
- Embed a sample chunk set and verify retrieval answers a question with the right doc.

## Compliance

Honor robots.txt (webcrawl reads it); keep crawl rates modest; prefer `llms.txt` when offered — it's the site telling you exactly what's meant for machines. For sites that challenge automated clients, see the webcrawl-protected-sites skill.
